          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            This project analyzes Amazon book reviews to extract customer sentiment and identify
            patterns in user feedback. Using a large-scale reviews dataset from Kaggle, the goal
            was to build a model that predicts whether a review is positive or negative and
            provide insights that can support product and marketing decisions.

          <h3>Data &amp; Tools</h3>
          <p>
            Worked with the Amazon Books Reviews dataset, which spans nearly two decades of customer
            reviews and ratings across hundreds of thousands of book titles. For modeling, a smaller,
            balanced subset was sampled and manually labeled.

            <strong>Tools:</strong> Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, VADER, Naive Bayes, SVM, Excel

        <!-- Approach -->
        <article class="card">
          <h3>Approach</h3>
          <ul class="project-points">
            <li>Sampled 2,000 reviews from the full dataset and curated a balanced labeled subset of 500 reviews.</li>
            <li>Cleaned and preprocessed review text, removed duplicates, and standardized formatting.</li>
            <li>Compared sentiment labeling methods including VADER, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes.</li>
            <li>Used manually labeled data to train and evaluate multiple classifiers (Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM).</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Results &amp; Impact</h3>
          <ul class="project-points">
            <li>Support Vector Machine achieved the best overall performance, with accuracy around 86% on the labeled set.</li>
            <li>Balanced recall across sentiment classes reduced bias toward a single label.</li>
            <li>
              Demonstrated a workflow that can be scaled to monitor customer sentiment at scale and help businesses
              understand perception of products, refine marketing strategies, and improve customer experience.
