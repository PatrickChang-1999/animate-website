    <h2>📘 Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This project analyzes Amazon book reviews to extract customer sentiment and
        identify patterns in user feedback. Using a dataset of over 142 million reviews 
        from Kaggle, our goal is to develop a predictive model that accurately classifies 
        review sentiment.

    <h2>📊 Dataset Summary</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Source: Amazon Books Reviews Dataset (Kaggle)</li>
        <li>Time Span: 1996 – 2014</li>
        <li>142.8M total reviews</li>
        <li>3M unique users</li>
        <li>212,404 unique books</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧹 Data Preparation</h2>
    <p>
        2000 reviews were randomly sampled from the full dataset, then narrowed to a
        balanced dataset of 500 reviews using stratified sampling. Reviews were cleaned,
        duplicates removed, and manually labeled for accurate training.

    <h2>⚙️ Sentiment Labeling & Modeling</h2>
    <p>
        We compared multiple sentiment labeling methods including VADER, Logistic Regression,
        and Naïve Bayes. Naïve Bayes showed better alignment with manual labels and was used
        to bootstrap sentiment labels for unlabeled records.

    <h2>🤖 Final Predictive Model</h2>
    <p>
        After evaluating Decision Trees, Random Forest, and SVM, the Support Vector Machine
        achieved the best accuracy (~86%) with balanced recall for both sentiment classes.

    <h2>🏁 Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Manual labeling combined with machine learning produced strong predictive performance.
        The insights from this project can help businesses understand consumer perception,
        improve product strategies, and support data-driven decision-making.
